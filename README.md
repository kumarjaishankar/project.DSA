This repository contains two projects: a Maze Generator and Solver and a Typing Speed Test.

The Maze Generator and Solver: 
Python-based program that generates random mazes of customizable sizes and displays them with paths and walls. 
It allows users to interact with the maze, providing options to view the maze, find a path, or generate a new maze. 
While the program currently does not have a pathfinding algorithm implemented, it provides a great starting point for maze-solving functionalities.

The Typing Speed Test:
Python program that measures typing speed by challenging users to type programming-related words from various languages. 
It tracks your typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM) and maintains a leaderboard of top scores. 
Players can start a test, view their results, and check the leaderboard to see how they rank against others. 
The results are stored in a leaderboard file in JSON format.

Both projects are standalone and can be run independently. 
The Maze Generator is focused on maze creation and visualization, while the Typing Speed Test offers a fun way to test and improve your typing skills with a competitive element.
